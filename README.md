# MyProjects

This is an application for managing personal projects and having statistics on these projects.
The application gives the possibility to create several projects grouped by categories and sorted by priority.
Authentication is required on the app.

  The application works as follows: 
    -> You have a vertical menu with the option to add a project. Depending on the boxes checked, three types of projects are available to you. The projects with values, those with steps and those whose steps have values.
    -> The created projects you can manage from the tab "MyProjects" of the vertical menu. And thus enter your progress in an intuitive way.
    -> From the Stats tab of the vertical menu, you can consult stats like the number of completed projects, the number of late projects, your task execution score... 
    -> Your data is stored in a secure database and only you have access to it.
